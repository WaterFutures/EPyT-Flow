MSX 2.0.0
07/05/2023

1. Improved water quality mass balance and mass balance reporting as in EPANET 2.2.

2. Dispersion modeling as an option to be included in water quality simulation.

3. OPENMP parallelization for both reaction and dispersion simulation codes.

4. A batch fle (runvc.bat) is provided to automatically launch the Visual Studio C/C++ compiler and compile the reaction equations.


MSX 1.1.00
02/08/2011

1. A new compilation option for the user's chemistry functions
was added that makes the program run anywhere from 2 to ten
times faster. Details are in the Users Manual.

2. Problems related to the exponentiation operator (^) used
in math expressions were fixed.

3. A new error message (number 524) was added that detects if
an expression tries to perform an illegal math operation.

4. Several bugs in the routines that implement the MSXsavemsxfile
toolkit function were fixed.

5. A memory leak occurring when the MSXclose toolkit function is
called was fixed.

6. A possible unterminated string copy was fixed in the MSXgetID
toolkit function.

7. Temporary files are now created in the user's current working
directory.

MSX 1.00.01
05/05/2008

The following bugs are fixed.

1. Report file specified in the [REPORT] section of the msx configuration file is not generated. Instead the multispecies modeling results are written to the EPANET report file.

2. Memory violation error may occur when toolkit function MSXsavemsxfile is called.

3. A source node which is defined as “setpoint” source behaves like “flowpaced” source and vice versa.

4. MSXsetpattern did not set the current patternvalue index to be the first.

5. Pipe roughness is added as a reserved hydraulic variable. The keyword is Kc.
